    <h3>Python vs. Scratch</h3>
    <p>
      Python has data types, objects, classes, and global functions and variables. You need those to make the thing do the stuff real well. Scratch is similar to Python in the respect that it does, in fact, make the thing do the stuff. Python just does it better.

    <h3>Debugging</h3>
    <p>
      Debugging is a pain, but it's necesary. The best part of debugging is the feeling you get afterwards. You fixed a problem, you did good! The harder it is to debug, the better you feel when it's done.
